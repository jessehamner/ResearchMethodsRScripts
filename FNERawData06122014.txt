It gives the librarian an opportunity to list accomplishments, professional development, and so on.  You get to see at the start of the process what you have accomplished, whether it is a statistic or adaption to changes in the workplace such as a new online system or adoption of a new code.  People should be prompted to consider seminars attended, day to day training of others, availability to aid/consult with others, and so on as valuable contributions.  They should be encouraged to list accomplishments in these areas even if they seem routine. "	"Gaining more experience through interacting with others (consulting/asking for or giving assistance), training, and just day to day work on the job does build your expertise in an area.  Be open to helping others.  Realize that everyone makes mistakes.  Don't be to down on yourself.  Give yourself credit for what you accomplish each day!  Over the years, these sorts of things have helped me build confidence.  I used to have many more work anxieties early in my career than I do now. Part of that, of course, is maturity, and part of it is simply that I am accustomed to my role and work with people who value that role."	33.9499054	-83.375	-1

A lot of my fear stems from lack of communication. Having only one evaluation a year with no chats or side comments to suggest I'm doing well puts a lot of pressure on that one evaluation.

"Librarians in management/administration position need to actually learn how to do those types of jobs.

Leadership needs to communicate clearly about the role of performance evaluations and ensure that people know that evaluations can be used to support growth and learning.  People too often tie performance evaluations with disciplinary actions.  Managers need to address personnel problems in advance of performance evaluations so they are less linked in staff's minds.  Take a look at the work of Senge and others who write about organizational learning.	"Take time to nurture yourself and to reflect honestly on your strengths and weaknesses.  No one comes into any profession fully equipped to deal with all aspects of it.  Librarianship takes place in a fast changing environment.

For me, a big part of being concerned about a negative eval has to do with what I think is poor managerial skills. With my current supervisor, I know where I stand. He is consistent with praise and yet is willing to remind me in an adult non-passive aggressive way where I need to make changes. My previous supervisor was not like this. We supervisees didn't know where we stood, thus creating anxiety at least in me. During the previous supervisor's evals she would try to make comments about an area of improvement, that were 'wack'. She didn't have the necessary skills to effectively communicate about both positive work success and areas that needed improvement/change."	"Based on my previous response, I think more skilled managers would be great. Another piece of this is lack of clear identification of expectations by admin to librarians. Of course I'm going to fear an eval if I don't know what is expected of me. "	Try to get admin to be really clear about what they expect; learn how to manage up.

However my institution has a religious aspect to its mission that I have to be careful not to disagree with publically.	"It takes two to tango. Supervisors/managers should strive to be as objective as possible in their evaluations and criticism should be made with an offer of support or advice to resolve something. Unfortunately, there are people in supervisory positions that abuse their positions of power. Sometimes they are just irrational and can't step back and think of their employees as people to nurture and mentor. Those are the toughest situations and unfortunately it only takes one ""bad"" manager to impact an entire department or library."

Basically, amass evidence - a body of work - that would contradict a negative evaluation by a supervisor."	Having a mentor can be a great help.

However, I have encountered librarians in supervisory roles who should never have been given managerial responsibilities. My recommendation then would be to improve within the profession an understanding of what makes a good manager, and make sure these skills are required when hiring."	"Again, focus on what you can control: the quality of you work. Front-end librarians must work with people, so those who have great anxiety related to negative evaluation should steer clear of those positions! For those in behind-the-scenes or research positions, pay some attention to the workplace environment and to the quality of the person hiring you.

I feel that men would rarely be concerned about being criticized and women, taught to socially please, are more concerned in different ways. The idea of this ""social anxiety"" has many gender biases and possibly gender-based implications. Though librarianship is largely a female profession, many of the managerial and high-level academic positions in libraries are held by men. I think what has affected my career is disempowerment, and librarianship as a profession is not empowering.   "	"I think that libraries tend to pull managerial staff from the ranks of librarians, who have little or no managerial experience and then simply set them at the task. If they've been great at their job, they get promoted but may be ill-prepared to actually supervise or manage. I think libraries really need to look hard at this tendency and start to train those they are promoting into management to do that kind of work. It requires a very specific set of skills and a delicate understanding of interpersonal and social relationships and patterns. I think libraries suffer tremendously from a lack of true leadership and from the issues described in The Leadership Pipeline. Giving staff leadership roles and skills across the organization, and trusting in staff's capabilities, would help. Libraries, for being so dedicated to providing excellent services to their patrons, are frequently very disempowering organizations for staff. They tend to be very hierarchical and rigid. This is in part due to the libraries' and librarianships' overall fears and negative self-perceptions as a profession. Individuals within the profession are bound to be negatively impacted by the disempowerment of the profession as a whole.   "	"Supportive management and feeling empowered are entwined, but you can create a work environment for yourself in which you feel empowered by taking ownership of your job duties. It takes time, persistence, perseverance, and a lot of gumption. But it can be done. Then when you have negative interactions, you can more quickly let them go because you have other things that fulfill you. If you cannot accomplish this in your organization (it can seem nearly impossible depending on your management and the structure within which you work), then create an empowering and fulfilling life outside the library and concentrate on the ""life"" part of the ""work life balance."" Also, promote more women into leadership roles where you have the power to do so.  Empower librarianship as a profession. And don't pathologize gendered experiences or disenfranchised-persons' experiences within corporate (or other) cultures.   "	40.71429443	-74.0059967	-1

"It would depend on why the fear of negative evaluations exists.  If someone is going to lose their job due to a negative evaluation, then the corporate culture and perhaps the budget should be reevaluated and changes made.  If the fear is because a program or plan failed, then steps to improve or salvage that plan must be taken.

I think you become concerned when a pattern of behavior emerges overtime - the same criticisms regardless of the work environment or evaluator.  	"I think managers and supervisors need to receive actual training in how to conduct evaluations and what's appropriate to include.  For example, if someone snaps at you, rather than noting it on an evalution talk to the person about their behavior (this has happened to me). Or don't single someone out if all the employess exhibit the same behaviors (again, this has happened to me). I think workplaces need to formulate guidelines on what is appropriate to include and what's not. Also, evaluations shouldn't be used as management tools or as the basis for decisions.  Rather than working to improve or educate a problem employee, poor managers use evaluations to force employees to quit or scare them into submission. "	"Document, document, document!  Always keeps copies of the good things people say about you, always note your achievements. Your manager, particularly poor ones, don't do this. They focus on the bad.  Also, don't be afraid to tell your manager when it's inappropriate to include something on an evaluation (bad days).  Ultimately, do your job the best you can. We're not here to get good evaluations, we're here to hellp people. "	46.59269714	-112.0361023	-1

"No matter what the organization is, it's always important to hire good people and then empower them with the knowledge that you know they are good and you trust them.

Otherwise nothing creative or innovative can happen.  Celebrate every victory they make.  That's the first and most important step.  And next, curb your tendency to point out their failures.  Let them know you're glad they tried."	I really strongly recommend therapy.  I am taking this survey anonymously so I have no problem saying that I go to a therapist and it has helped my confidence and self-esteem immensely.

I am confident in the quantity and quality of work I do, especially as it compares to my peers. I also prefer to keep lines of communication open with my superiors so that if there is a concern they're having, it can be addressed before my evaluation. I am not as concerned with judgments from colleagues who are not my superior. In the case of evaluations from patrons, I find that I often receive more praise than complaint, which reinforces what I'm doing."	"Managers need to have an open door policy, and there needs to be constant communication with their staff about what is going well and what can be improved. I find that people who fear a negative evaluation often don't know what their supervisor thinks of their work. I feel like workplaces have a better environment when management gives constructive feedback and solves any problems by working with the employee as problems arise."	"Talk to your manager as often as you can about your progress. Casual conversations help you know how they feel about your work, so that when it comes time for your formal evaluation, there are no surprises. I also feel like you need to be proud of the work you've accomplished and be confident that you are working to your full ability. I think that means evaluating yourself and determining if the quality and quantity of your work meets a high standard."	33.01460266	-97.09700012	-1

Be sure to conclude with having the employee tell you what they 'heard' in the evaluation so you have a chance to correct any negative filters that discounted the good points.  Setting short-term goals to work on weakness can be useful.  Also taking time throughout the year to affirm employees goes a long way towards building confidence.

"Make sure your supervisor knows why something didn't go right or why you did not meet a goal, if you are afraid that it might come up in an evaluation.

I want to know if someone has critical feedback to share with me so that I can consider the validity of the statement and determine whether or not I should amend my actions/behaviour.	"I would recommend restructuring the evaluation process and developing a workplace of trust and support.  Regular check-ins and coaching sessions should be part of the evaluation process so that employees aren't hearing lots of negative feedback at once, also, so that the pressure of evaluation is reduced from a big yearly event to a regular ongoing part of work.  Also, if an employee knows he/she is going to be coached and supported through problem areas that might help reduce fear."	"I would ask them to remember that we are in a field that values life-long learning.  We value that for staff as well as our customers.  Try to redefine negative feedback on an evaluation as a way to focus your professional life-long learning.  To make our workplaces as effective and efficient as possible, every person at every level needs to be developing and improving their skills.  If your supervisor has identified an area that needs growth, don't view it as an indictment of your entire performance or value as an employee/person, try to view it as a place to focus your energy for improvement.  Also, talk to your supervisor if their feedback system isn't working for you.  Try to come to a mutually beneficial system. "	43.54690552	-116.2913055	-1

Provide continual feedback rather than waiting for a formal evaluation to communicate praise or concerns. Limit remarks concerning weak areas of job performance to private conversation with the individual involved. Provide frequent positive feedback. Provide social interaction in non-threatening situations.	"Once while dealing with strong criticism from my supervisor - which, unfortunately, was warranted - I realized, ""I am constantly seeking to improve my job performance through professional development and readings in my field.  If my supervisor had come to me and said, ""Would you like to know how you can improve as a librarian?"" I would have promptly answered, ""YES!"" I need to rethink my response to this criticism and see it as an opportunity to improve professionally and personally."" Ever since that epiphany, I have always tried (with varying levels of succes!) to view my annual performance review as well as other criticisms of my work as an opportunity to become an even better librarian."	30.5019989	-87.36009979	-1

"The metrics that people are being evaluated on need to be clear and transparent. People should be able to see their evaluations and respond to them. Evaluation should be consistent across employees (i.e. everyone should feel they are in the same boat, in terms of their work being evaluated). It should also be consistent in the sense that employees should know and expect to be evaluated and they should know what kind of feedback they are going to get (goes back to being transparent about the metrics). Supervisors giving the evaluation should make sure to give both positive feedback and constructive criticism. These recommendations all come from my past jobs in the business world and when these guidelines were followed, I appreciated being evaluated and felt that it made me a better employee. It also made me more comfortable and confident because I KNEW what my supervisor/superiors thought of my work, I didn't have to guess and worry."	"Not to be harsh, but I think it's a little ridiculous that librarians would *fear* negative evaluation. In most other careers/industries, evaluations are just part of the culture and you just deal with it. Of course it can be done poorly, can feel personal, etc. and that's never good, so if that's the environment I could understand the fear, but just fearing criticism overall is silly - how are you ever going to get better at your job if no one ever tells you what you need to work on?!

"A culture of learning (including freedom to learn from failure); an atmosphere of trust and respect; open and continuous communication and feedback; and clearly defined performance expectations. Nobody should be surprised by anything in an annual evaluation, especially ""gotchas"" on events that went unaddressed at the time; a supervisor should be giving explicit feedback (and soliciting it) throughout the year."	"I believe FNE is closely tied to impostor syndrome, and working on that would help. Practicing recognition of successes, however small, can help develop a sense of competence and confidence. Considering failures in the context of your successes can help keep them in perspective. Most librarians aren't generally involved in safety-critical work, so unless one's supervisor is really difficult, most mistakes are 1) fixable and/or 2) not truly harmful.  If your supervisor *is* really difficult, it may not matter what your mistakes (if any) are; evaluation is out of your control anyway., and it will have far more to do with your supervisor than you or your actual performance. Sometimes supervisors are difficult because of their own FNE...but if there's no trust between you, that doesn't really matter in the end."	46.62879944	-87.479599	-1

Though I don't exactly hate this. It's more like a reality of ANY job where you aren't your own boss and someone has the opportunity to arbitrarily fire or cause problems for you. Being in a unionized workplace helps a lot, but I still find myself doing more to simply please my superiors than to challenge myself or do anything personally fulfilling in my work."	At least in a unionized workplace you have the security of knowing that you have formal representation and support if someone is making your work life unecessarily bad. I don't know that there's much to be done on a personal level as far as coping. I need the income from my job just ot survive as I live paycheck to paycheck so there's a lot of anxiety there. I literally can't afford to screw up so even the perception that I might be is a major issue. If I had any savings or enough income to live on that wasn't just month to month I'd have more security and could work without so much fear. 	"Try not to let it bother you. Keep looking for a better work environment. Like I said above, without monetary security and some sense of safety in your work environment any coping stategy can only do so much."	47.03790283	-122.9006958	-1

My latest director, who is my age, only listens to younger, newer librarians, which is valid sometimes, but not aways.  I think she fears negative evaluations from her VP.  Always wants to be on the cutting edge, but like me, can't be innovative.   Not everyone can be an innovator, but good work should be valued whether innovative or enduring.  Not everyone can be a genius, and they shouldn't be expected to be.

Not everyone can do that, and the work environment should allow for mistakes, because that is how people learn.  No one is going to die, if you try something and it doesn't work.  And you don't change or innovate processes because of a few mistakes.   Look at the big picture, and if you feel you are contributing, you shouldn't fear evaluations. Evaluations are always subjective, evaluate your evaluator.  If you realize they are motivated by helping their staff to do a good job, as opposed to finding ways of making themselves look good to their boss, then why should you fear  their evaluation?  If you respect them, then listen to what they have to say.   "	29.87289429	-98.01399994	-1

I am not fearful/worried when receiving performance evaluations.  In that context, I see the 'negative' evaluation as constructive feedback and an opportunity to improve.  Granted, it does make a huge difference how the supervisor delivers the evaluation. "	"Having been a supervisor at one time, I am aware of the role that managers/supervisors can play in setting the appropriate culture/environment to minimize the creation of 'negative' evaluations to begin with. 1. Top management needs to establish a culture/environment whereby all employees buy-in to 'continuous improvement' in operations and service to achieve the organization's mission.  Let's not rest on our laurels.  How can we continue to improve serving our users? 2. 2. Supervisors need to better understand the nature of why a person is moving in the direction of a negative evalution?  Are they not motivated?  Are there interpersonal communication issues?  Does the job not fit their skill set?  Overloaded with work?   What can the supervisor do to raise the performance level of the employee?  Training?  Change in work schedule if possible?  3. 3. Supervisors can work with the librarian to develop annual performance goals/objectives and meet regularly (montly, quarterly, ..) to discuss progress and any issues that have arisen.  The supervisor needs to be part of the solution to enhancing the employee's contribution.  4. 4. Supervisors need to provide positive feedback reinforcing the employee's contributions in addition to the constructive feedback.  The constructive feedback can be associated with the desired end goal that everyone's working toward.   5. 5. To achieve the above, supervisors need to be trained on the roles and responsibilities that they have towards their staff.   It doesn't come natural to many supervisors on how to 'read' an employee and understand his/her strengths/weaknesses; how to have those difficult conversations; what it means to support one's staff;  creating an environment where people want to come to work.  "	"My initial response is to recommend counseling.  Much of this fear of negative evaluation is deep-seated and long-standing.  It's not a personal issue that is easily addressed with simple platitudes.   Having said that, there are numerous workshops that can help people refocus their attention on the possibilities that can come from receiving negative feedback."	36.03779602	-78.9858017	-1

I am lucky to work for an organization that recognizes hard work. I know that doing my job to the best of my ability will guarantee a good review, although I am always a little nervous around evaluation time."	Expectations need to be clearly defined and communicated to staff members. Superviors need to assure staff members that meeting these expectations will result in a good review. I think fear results from an unawareness of evaluation criteria or if the evaluation feels arbitrary.    	"Foster an open relationship with your supervisor by asking for their expectations and whether or not they are being met. It would be helpful to have an ongoing, informal evalution dialogue between staff and supervisors instead of a once a year ""big"" event. I think that fear will dissipate if the focus is taken away from the ""big"" event evalution and is done informally throughout the year.     "	40.28269958	-83.05590057	-1

Because of years cultivating reasons why people should give me a positive evaluation, I am well respected and actually just recently found out that my organization and colleagues really do think positively of me and my services, when i didn't think of myself positively.  If I didn't care about negative evaluations, I probably wouldn't go the extra mile all the time to really reduce the risk of a negative evaluation."	"Leadership retreats (PNLA, MPLA), workshops, books (there are some GREAT books on self-development out there!), articles, Continuing Education on relevant topics, and opportunities for employees to go to non-library leadership retreats, with no one else from their library, or at most, one trustworthy co-worker from their library."	"Be gentle and patient with yourself.  You're a work in progress, and you have to have these experiences to build empathy, which makes you a far better person for helping others.  When the time is right for you, and you're open to self-development, you will pick up life lessons and learnings which will help lessen the fear of negative evaluation.  It's helpful to know that even those who don't seem to care what others think of them really honestly don't plan to do shoddy work.  Everyone intrinsically wants to do good....even the person doing the evaluation may not be good at doing evaluations.  It's not you personally, are you being hard on yourself?  Do you really know yourself?  Can you see yourself through others' eyes?  I once had a wise manager in my organization tell me, if you hear something negative from one or two people, automatically dismiss it.  If you start to hear it from three or more, perhaps pay attention.  The trick is to make sure you heard them say it, that it's just not your assumption or your internal thought you're placing on someone else.  With me being insecure, I had a wake up call when I was sitting in an audience of a business conference (non-library) lecture and the speaker stated clearly that being insecure is actually the same as being selfish - I had an initial intense reaction in my mind ""What?!  No it's not!  I give myself away to make sure people think positively of me!!"" but as I quieted my mind and kept listening, the lecturer went on to explain; with fear, your focus is inward, in to the self, hence selfish.  So, to not be selfish, your focus should be outside of your self, serving others; you're seeking to help others.  I concluded being a great librarian is focusing on others, outward, seeking what information gaps others have and how you can fill those gaps for them to make life easier for them.  Once you consistently focus on that, you will one day realize that your fear of negative evaluation isn't as gripping as it was when you initially started focusing outward.  I am at a point in my life and career that I'm still surprised by all the positive acknowledgements, but I don't have that gripping sense of fear any more. "	48.19869995	-114.3856964	-1

"library supervisors and library administrators need to have these discussions with employees. i've had only one supervisor say that the annual evaluation process was a conversation, not a one-way process supervisor to employee. she believed that there should be no surprises at the annual review because issues will have been addressed long before the annual review sit-down."	"not sure if this fear of negative evaluation is a gender issue, but i find that my male librarian colleagues are not fearful at all--they say what they mean. they're not afraid of ""playing nice"" and seem to be less concerned about being judged by colleagues. my advice would be to realize that there's no such thing as perfection. talk to a variety of colleagues and get their advice, take professional development webinars that address what are the actual underlying reasons for the ""fear.""

I do feel that Im an overly anxious person about my performance, and others opinions about me, as my results probably show, but I feel like my anxiety is not always a bad thing because it pushes me to go out of my way to make myself an important part of what we do, and to take every opportunity where I can help others and do my job well.

"A mentor once told me to just ask once in awhile ""How am I doing?"" in order to keep a finger on the pulse when working with a leader who doesn't offer much feedback outside of the evaluation."	36.09989929	-80.24420166	-1

It has been my experience that they are not used as guidelines for improvement but as threats.  Being on the giving and on the receiving end has been educational.  I have been absolutely stunned by a poor review [why didn't I know ahead of time that you were unhappy with my performance in this area?] and have been instructed to prepare ""low-ball"" evaluations for my team to avoid raise negotiations [nothing higher than ""satisfactory"" unless they have actually leapt buildings in a single bound or saved Gotham from certain destruction]."	More frequent evaluations - a more regular review of what's being done right & where to focus on change would at least alleviate the pressure of whether you're performance is about to get trashed for the previous year.

It is obvious who is in good graces within our library and who is not. This creates unneeded artificial divisions between staff and departments. "	I wish I knew. Perhaps seek strategies for how to identify and preemptively address the areas of work performance that create the fear.
